## R and RStudio

I’m assuming that you already installed R and RStudio. If that is not
the case, you can check these links and follow the corresponding
instructions:

  - Install **R**
      - R for Mac: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>
      - R for windows: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
  - Install **RStudio**
      - RStudio download:
        <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

### About the R-GUI

When you install R, it comes with a basic graphical user interface
(GUI). Launching the R-GUI will let you interact with R in a
“minimalist” way.

![Basic R-GUI console](01-images/screen-rgui.png)

Nowadays, however, it is more convenient to interact with R through a
more advanced and sophisticated development environment like RStudio.

![RStudio IDE](01-images/screen-rstudio.png)

Difference between R-GUI and RStudio:

  - R-GUI is a simple graphical user interface.
  - RStudio is an *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE).
      - It is much more than a simple GUI.
      - It provides a nice working environment and development
        framework.
  - In this course you are going to use mainly RStudio.
  - But remember: RStudio is NOT R\!
  - RStudio is like an outer layer that makes it easy to interact with
    R.

## The R Console

For the most part in this course, you are going to be working with R in
what is called **interactive mode**. This means establishing a
*dialogue* between you and R. How? By writing commands, executing them,
checking the output, and repeating these steps again, and again, until
you get the job done. The main device to establish this interaction is
the so-called **console**. This is where commands get executed, and it
is also the place where most outputs get displayed.

There are various ways to work with R in interactive mode (via its
console):

  - Using the basic R-GUI.
  - Using R via RStudio (or any other IDE).
  - Using R via a terminal emulator (e.g. command line).

Just for illustration purposes, I will briefly show you the basic R-GUI.
However, your main workbench will be RStudio.

## NBA Player Data Set

To have a working example that allows us to introduce and discuss many
of the concepts in this course, I will make extensive use of data about
NBA players. The main source is the website
<http://www.basketball-reference.com>.

To make things more concrete, let’s focus on data about the Golden State
Warriors. Below are two screenshots; the first one shows part of the
season statistics, and the second one shows the player salaries:

  - `Rk`: Rank of player
  - Name of player
  - `Age` of player
  - `G` number of games played
  - `GS` nuber of games started
  - `MP` minutes played
  - `FG` number of field goals (3-pts and 2-pts shots)
  - `FGA` number of field goal attempts

## R as a scientific calculator

The most recommended way to break the ice with R is by using it as a
scientific calculator. Open RStudio and locate the *console* (or
prompt). Let’s start typing basic calculations in the console:

  - addition

<!-- end list -->

``` r
1 + 1
2 + 3
```

  - subtraction

<!-- end list -->

``` r
4 - 2
5 - 7
```

  - multiplication

<!-- end list -->

``` r
10 * 0
7 * 7
```

  - division

<!-- end list -->

``` r
9 / 3
1 / 2
```

  - power

<!-- end list -->

``` r
5 ^ 2
2 ^ 3
```

### Functions

R has many functions. To use a function, type its name followed by
parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis you pass one or more inputs. Most
functions will display some sort of output on the console:

  - absolute value

<!-- end list -->

``` r
abs(-4)
```

    ## [1] 4

  - square root

<!-- end list -->

``` r
sqrt(9)
```

    ## [1] 3

  - natural logarithm

<!-- end list -->

``` r
log(2)
```

    ## [1] 0.6931472

## Variables and Assignments

R is more powerful than a calculator, and you can do many more things
than practically most scientific calculators. One of the things you will
be doing a lot in R is creating variables or objects to store values.

For instance, you can create a variable `thompson` and give it the value
of Field Goals made by Klay Thompson (644). This is done using what is
known as the **assignment operator** `<-`, also known in R as the
*arrow* operator:

``` r
thompson <- 644
thompson
```

    ## [1] 644

This is a way to tell R: create an object `thompson` and store in it the
number 644. Alternatively, you can use the equals sign `=` as an
assignment operator. Here’s how to create a variable (or object)
`curry`:

``` r
curry = 675
curry
```

    ## [1] 675

With variables, you can operate in the same way you do algebraic
operations:

``` r
thompson + curry
```

    ## [1] 1319

``` r
thompson - curry
```

    ## [1] -31

``` r
thompson * curry
```

    ## [1] 434700

``` r
thompson / curry
```

    ## [1] 0.9540741

### Case Sensitive

R is case sensitive. This means that `abs()` is not the same as `Abs()`
or `ABS()`. Only the function `abs()` is the valid one. When working
with variables and objects, make sure you are calling the right name:

``` r
# case sensitive
green <- 272
durant <- 551
Durant <- 0

green + durant
```

    ## [1] 823

``` r
green + Durant
```

    ## [1] 272

``` r
durant + Durant
```

    ## [1] 551

### Comments in R

All programming languages use a set of characters to indicate that a
specifc part or lines of code are **comments**, that is, things that are
not to be executed. R uses the hash or pound symbol `#` to specify
comments. Any code to the right of `#` will not be executed by R.

``` r
# this is a comment
# this is another comment
thompson + curry

thompson + curry + green  # you can place comments like this
```

### Some Examples

Here are some examples that illustrate how to use R to define variables
and perform basic calculations:

``` r
# convert Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees
fahrenheit <- 50
celsius <- (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
print(celsius)
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
# compute the area of a rectangle
rec_length <- 10
rec_height <- 5
rec_area <- rec_length * rec_height
rec_area
```

    ## [1] 50

``` r
# degrees to radians
deg <- 90
rad <- (deg * pi) / 180
rad
```

## More about RStudio

You will be working with RStudio a lot, and you will have time to learn
most of the bells and whistles RStudio provides. Think about RStudio as
your “workbench”. Keep in mind that RStudio is NOT R. RStudio is an
environment that makes it easier to work with R, while taking care of
many of the little tasks than can be a hassle.

### A quick tour of RStudio

  - Understand the **pane layout** (i.e. windows) of RStudio
      - Source
      - Console
      - Environment, History, etc
      - Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer
  - Customize RStudio Appearance of source pane
      - font
      - size
      - background

### Getting help

Because we work with functions all the time, it’s important to know
certain details about how to use them, what input(s) is required, and
what is the returned output.

There are several ways to get information about a function in R. We
refer to this as “getting help”.

If you know the name of a function you are interested in knowing more,
you can use the function `help()` and pass it the name of the function
you are looking for:

``` r
# documentation about the 'abs' function
help(abs)

# documentation about the 'mean' function
help(mean)
```

Alternatively, you can use a shortcut using the question mark `?`
followed by the name of the function:

``` r
# documentation about the 'abs' function
?abs

# documentation about the 'mean' function
?mean
```

  - Anatomy of the manual documentation of a function:
      - Title
      - Description
      - Usage of function
      - Arguments
      - Details
      - See Also
      - Examples\!\!\!

`help()` only works if you know the name of the function your are
looking for. Sometimes, however, you don’t know the name but you may
know some keywords. To look for related functions associated to a
keyword, use `help.search()` or simply a double question mark: `??`

``` r
# search for 'absolute'
help.search("absolute")

# alternatively you can also search like this:
??absolute
```

Notice the use of quotes surrounding the input name inside
`help.search()`

### Example: NBA Player Variables

Let’s go back to the Warriors data. Often, you want to create variables
or objects that store more than one value. One way to do this in R is
with **vectors**, which is the most basic data structure. To create a
vector you can use the *combine* function `c()` by passing different
values separated by comma:

``` r
# last name
player <- c('Thompson', 'Curry', 'Green', 'Durant', 'Iguodala')

# field goals
goals <- c(644, 675, 272, 551, 219)

# salary (dollars)
salary <- c(16663575, 12112359, 15330435, 26540100, 11131368)
```

In this case we don’t really have all the points scored by each player
but we have information about the field goals (combined number of
2-points and 3-points goals).

In order to investigate our research question, we can start visualizing
the data with a scatterplot of `goals` and `salary` using the function
`plot()`:

``` r
plot(goals, salary)
text(goals, salary, labels = player)
```

![](01-images/plot-scatter-1.png)<!-- -->

Furthermore, we can calculate the correlation coefficient:

``` r
cor(goals, salary)
```

### Installing Packages

R comes with a large set of functions and packages. A package is a
collection of functions that have been designed for a specific purpose.
One of the great advantages of R is that many analysts, scientists,
programmers, and users can create their own pacakages and make them
available for everybody to use them. R packages can be shared in
different ways. The most common way to share a package is to submit it
to what is known as **CRAN**, the *Comprehensive R Archive Network*.

You can install a package using the `install.packages()` function. Just
give it the name of a package, surrounded by qoutes, and R will look for
it in CRAN, and if it finds it, R will download it to your computer.

``` r
# installing
install.packages("knitr")
```

You can also install a bunch of packages at once:

``` r
install.packages(c("readr", "ggplot2"))
```

Once you installed a package, you can start using its functions by
*loading* the package with the function `library()`

``` r
library("knitr")
library("ggplot2")
```

Notice that when invoking `library()`, you can type the name of the
package without using quotes:

``` r
# no quotes
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Example: Plots for NBA data

The package `"ggplot2"` provides a wide range of functions to create
nicer graphics than those offered in base R. We will cover how the
functions in `"ggplot2"` work in a couple of weeks. In the meantime,
here’s some sample code to create a more visually apealing scatterplot:

``` r
dat <- data.frame(
  player = player,
  goals = goals,
  salary = salary
)

dat
```

    ##     player goals   salary
    ## 1 Thompson   644 16663575
    ## 2    Curry   675 12112359
    ## 3    Green   272 15330435
    ## 4   Durant   551 26540100
    ## 5 Iguodala   219 11131368

Scatter plot with `ggplot2()`

``` r
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = goals, y = salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = player))
```

![](01-images/ggplot-scatter-1.png)<!-- -->

### Quitting a session

To quit an R session, you can simply type the function `quit()` or its
abbreviated version `q()`.

By default, every time you quit a session, R will ask you if you want to
save your **workspace image**. What does this mean? Your *workspace*
involves all the objects that you’ve created in your current session. A
*workspace image*, in turn, is a special type of R file. This is
actually a binary file (using R’s native binary format), and the default
file extension is `.RData`. You can only open these files with R.

The workspace only contains the objects (variables, data objects,
functions that you have created). But it does not contain all the
commands that you’ve been invoking. The invoked commands, are actually
in a separate file.

R keeps a log of all the commands that you’ve used in the current (and
past) session(s). This log is known as the **history**, and R keeps this
information in another special file called by default `.Rhistory`. In
RStudio, you can actually see the history of your commands in the pane
that has the tabs `Environment` and `History`.

`.Rhistory` is a simple text file, and you should be able to find it in
your working directory.

-----

## Source Files

Most of the times you won’t be working directly on the console. Instead,
you will be typing your commands in some source file. The basic type of
source files are known as *R script* files, commonly referred to as `.R`
files. Another type of source file that is becoming quite popular are *R
Markdown* files or `.Rmd` files.

### Using an R script file

Open a new script file in the *source* pane and let’s rewrite some of
the previous commands.

How do you execute the commands in your source file? You can copy the
commands in your source file and paste them in the console. But that’s
not very efficient. Alternatively, you can run (execute) the commands
with some keyboard shortcuts. Or you can also use some buttons in
RStudio (look for the “Run” icon).

In the next tutorial we’ll see how to use the so-called `Rmd` files:
