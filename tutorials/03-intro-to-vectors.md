## NBA Data

In this tutorial, we are going to consider the 2016-2017 starting lineup
for the Golden State Warriors:

| Player   | Position | Salary     | Points | PPG  | Rookie |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| Thompson | SG       | 16,663,575 | 1742   | 22.3 | FALSE  |
| Curry    | PG       | 12,112,359 | 1999   | 25.3 | FALSE  |
| Green    | PF       | 15,330,435 | 776    | 10.2 | FALSE  |
| Durant   | SF       | 26,540,100 | 1555   | 25.1 | FALSE  |
| Pachulia | C        | 2,898,000  | 426    | 6.1  | FALSE  |

From the statistical point of view, we can say that there are six
variables measured on five individuals. How would you characterize each
variable: quantitative -vs- qualitative?

From the programming point of view, what type of data would you use to
encode each variable: character, boolean, integer, real?

## Vectors in R

Vectors are the most basic type of data structures in R. Learning how to
manipulate data structures in R requires you to start learning how to
manipulate vectors.

### Creating vectors with `c()`

Among the main functions to work with vectors we have the **combine**
function `c()`. This is the workhorse function to create vectors in R.
Here’s how to create a vector for the players with `c()`:

``` r
player <- c('Thompson', 'Curry', 'Green', 'Durant', 'Pachulia')
```

You can use the same function to create vectors `position`, `salary`,
and `ppg`

``` r
position <- c('SG', 'PG', 'PF', 'SF', 'C')
salary <- c(16663575, 12112359, 15330435, 26540100, 2898000)
ppg <- c(22.3, 25.3, 10.2, 25.1, 6.1)
```

As for `rookie` you can still use `c()` or also the repetition function
`rep()`:

``` r
rookie <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)

# alternatively
rookie <- rep(FALSE, 5)
```

### Vectors are Atomic structures

The first thing you should learn about R vectors is that they are
**atomic structures**, which is just the fancy name to indicate that all
the elements of a vector must be of the same type, either all numbers,
all characters, or all logical values. To test if an object is *atomic*,
i.e. has all its elements of the same type, use `is.atomic()`

How do you know that a given vector is of a certain data type? There are
several functions that allow you to answer this question:

  - `typeof()`
  - `class()`
  - `mode()`

One function to answer the previous question is `typeof()`:

``` r
typeof(player)
typeof(salary)
typeof(ppg)
typeof(rookie)
```

You should know that among the R community, most useRs don’t really talk
about *types*. Instead, because of historical reasons related to the S
language, you will often hear useRs talk about *modes*:

``` r
mode(player)
mode(salary)
mode(ppg)
mode(rookie)
```

## Manipulating Vectors: Subsetting

Subsetting refers to extracting elements of a vector (or another R
object). To do so, you use what is known as **bracket notation**. This
implies using (square) brackets `[ ]` to get access to the elements of a
vector:

``` r
# first element
player[1]
```

    ## [1] "Thompson"

``` r
# first three elements
player[1:3]
```

    ## [1] "Thompson" "Curry"    "Green"

What type of things can you specify inside the brackets? Basically:

  - numeric vectors
  - logical vectors (the length of the logical vector must match the
    length of the vector to be subset)
  - character vectors (if the elements have names)

### Subsetting with Numeric Indices

Here are some subsetting examples using a numeric vector inside the
brackets:

``` r
# fifth element of 'player'
player[4]

# numeric range
player[2:4]

# numeric vector
player[c(1, 3)]

# different order
player[c(3, 1, 2)]

# third element (four times)
player[rep(3, 4)]
```

### Subsetting with Logical Indices

Logical subsetting involves using a logical vector inside the brackets.
Learning about *logical subsetting* is a fundamental survival skill.
This kind of subsetting is **very powerful** because it allows you to
extract elements based on some logical condition.

Here’s a toy example of logical subsetting:

``` r
# dummy vector
a <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)

# logical subsetting
a[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

    ## [1] 5 7

Logical subsetting occurs when the vector of indices that you pass
inside the brackets is a logical vector.

To do logical subsetting, the vector that you put inside the brackets,
should match the length of the manipulated vector. If you pass a shorter
vector inside brackets, R will apply its recycling rules.

Notice that the elements of the vector that are subset are those which
match the logical value `TRUE`.

``` r
# your turn
player[c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)]
player[c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
player[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
player[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
player[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)]

# recycling
player[TRUE]
player[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
```

When subsetting a vector logically, most of the times you won’t really
be providing an explicit vector of `TRUE`’s and `FALSE`s. Just imagine
having a vector of 100 or 1000 or 1000000 elements, and trying to do
logical subsetting by manually creating a logical vector of the same
length. That would be very boring. Instead, you will be providing a
logical condition or a comparison operation that returns a logical
vector.

A **comparison operation** occurs when you use comparison operators such
as:

  - `>` greater than
  - `>=` greater than or equal
  - `<` less than
  - `<=` less than or equal
  - `==` equal
  - `!=` different

Notice that a comparison operation always returns a logical vector:

``` r
# example with '=='
player == 'Durant'

# example with '>'
ppg > 24
```

Here are some examples of logical subsetting:

``` r
# salary of Durant
salary[player == 'Durant']

# name of players with more than 24 points per game
player[ppg > 24]
```

In addition to using comparison operators, you can also use **logical
operators** to produce a logical vector. The most common type of logical
operators are:

  - `&` AND
  - `|` OR
  - `!` negation

Run the following commands to see what R does:

``` r
# AND
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
FALSE & FALSE

# OR
TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE

# NOT
!TRUE
!FALSE
```

More examples with comparisons and logical operators:

``` r
# name of players with salary between 10 and 20 millions (exclusive)
player[salary > 10000000 & salary < 20000000]

# name of players with salary between 10 and 20 millions (inclusive)
player[salary >= 10000000 & salary <= 20000000]
```

### Subsetting with Character Vectors

A third type of subsetting involves passing a character vector inside
brackets. When you do this, the characters are supposed to be names of
the manipulated vector.

None of the vectors `player`, `salary`, and `ppg`, have names. You can
confirm that with the `names()` function applied on any of the vectors:

``` r
names(salary)
```

    ## NULL

Create a new vector `millions` by converting `salary` into millions, and
then assign `player` as the names of `millions`

``` r
# create 'millions', rounded to 2 decimals
millions <- round(salary / 1000000, 2)

# assign 'player' as names of 'millions'
names(millions) <- player
```

You should have a vector `millions` with named elements. Now you can use
character subsetting:

``` r
millions["Durant"]
```

    ## Durant 
    ##  26.54

``` r
millions[c("Green", "Curry", "Pachulia")]
```

    ##    Green    Curry Pachulia 
    ##    15.33    12.11     2.90

### Adding more elements

Related with subsetting, you can consider adding more elements to a
given vector. For example, say you want to include data for three more
players: Iguodala, McCaw, and Jones:

| Player   | Position | Salary     | Points | PPG | Rookie |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | --- | ------ |
| Iguodala | SF       | 11,131,368 | 574    | 7.6 | FALSE  |
| McCaw    | SG       | 543,471    | 282    | 4.0 | TRUE   |
| Jones    | C        | 1,171,560  | 19     | 1.9 | TRUE   |

You can use bracket notation to add more elements:

``` r
player[6] <- 'Iguodala'
player[7] <- 'McCaw'
player[8] <- 'Jones'
```

Another option is to use `c()` to combine a vector with more values like
this:

``` r
position <- c(position, 'SF', 'SG', 'C')
rookie <- c(rookie, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
```

Of course, you can combine both options:

``` r
salary[6] <- 11131368
salary <- c(salary, 543471, 1171560)
```

## Vectorization

Say you want to create a vector `log_salary` by taking the logarithm of
salaries:

``` r
log_salary <- log(salary)
```

When you create the vector `log_salary`, what you’re doing is applying a
function to a vector, which in turn acts on all elements of the vector.

This is called **Vectorization** in R parlance. Most functions that
operate with vectors in R are **vectorized** functions. This means that
an action is applied to all elements of the vector without the need to
explicitly type commands to traverse all the elements.

In many other programming languages, you would have to use a set of
commands to loop over each element of a vector (or list of numbers) to
transform them. But not in R.

Another example of vectorization would be the calculation of the square
root of all the points per game `ppg`:

``` r
sqrt(ppg)
```

    ## [1] 4.722288 5.029911 3.193744 5.009990 2.469818

Or the conversion of `salary` into millions:

``` r
salary / 1000000 
```

### Why should you care about vectorization?

If you are new to programming, learning about R’s vectorization will be
very natural (you won’t stop to think about it too much). If you have
some previous programming experience in other languages (e.g. C, python,
perl), you know that vectorization does not tend to be a native thing.

Vectorization is essential in R. It saves you from typing many lines of
code, and you will exploit vectorization with other useful functions
known as the *apply* family functions (we’ll talk about them later in
the course).

## Recycling

Closely related with the concept of *vectorization* we have the notion
of **Recycling**. To explain *recycling* let’s see an example.

`salary` is given in dollars, but what if you need to obtain the
salaries in euros?. Let’s create a new vector `euros` with the converted
salaries in euros. To convert from dollars to euros use the following
conversion: 1 dollar = 0.9 euro

``` r
# your code here
```

What you just did (assuming that you did things correctly) is called
**Recycling**. To understand this concept, you need to remember that R
does not have a data structure for scalars (single numbers). Scalars are
in reality vectors of length 1.

Converting dollars to euros requires this operation: `salary * 0.9`.
Although it may not be obvious, we are multiplying two vectors: `salary`
and `0.9`. Moreover (and more important) **we are multiplying two
vectors of different lengths\!**. So how does R know what to do in this
cases?

Well, R uses the **recycling rule**, which takes the shorter vector (in
this case `0.9`) and recycles its elements to form a temporary vector
that matches the length of the longer vector (i.e. `salary`).

### Another recycling example

Here’s another example of recycling. Salaries of elements in an odd
number positions will be divided by two; salaries of elements in an even
number position will be divided by 10:

``` r
units <- c(1/2, 1/10)
new_salary <- salary * units
```

The elements of `units` are recycled and repeated as many times as
elements in `salary`. The previous command is equivalent to this:

``` r
new_units <- rep(c(1/2, 1/10), length.out = length(salary))
salary * new_units
```

## Factors

As mentioned before, vectors are the most essential type of data
structure in R. They are *atomic* structures (can contain only one type
of data): integers, real numbers, logical values, characters, complex
numbers.

Related to vectors, there is another important data structure in R
called **factor**. Factors are data structures exclusively designed to
handle categorical data.

The term *factor* as used in R for handling categorical variables, comes
from the terminology used in *Analysis of Variance*, commonly referred
to as ANOVA. In this statistical method, a categorical variable is
commonly referred to as *factor* and its categories are known as
*levels*.

### Creating Factors

To create a factor you use the homonym function `factor()`, which takes
a vector as input. The vector can be either numeric, character or
logical.

Looking at the available variables, we can treat *Position* and *Rooky*
as categorical variables. This means that we can convert the
corresponding vectors `position`, and `rooky` into factors.

``` r
# convert to factor
position <- factor(position)

position
```

    ## [1] SG PG PF SF C  SF SG C 
    ## Levels: C PF PG SF SG

``` r
rookie <- factor(rookie)
```

Notice how `position` and `rooky` are displayed. Even though the
elements are the same in both the vector and the factor, they are
printed in different formats. The letters in the factor are printed
without quotes.

### How does R store factors?

Under the hood, a factor is internally stored using two arrays (R
vectors): one is an integer array containing the values of the
categories, the other array is the “levels” which has the names of
categories which are mapped to the integers.

One way to confirm that the values of the categories are mapped as
integers is by using the function `storage.mode()`

``` r
# storage of factor
storage.mode(position)
```

    ## [1] "integer"

### Manipulating Factors

Because factors are internally stored as integers, you can manipulate
factors as any other vector:

``` r
position[1:5]
```

    ## [1] SG PG PF SF C 
    ## Levels: C PF PG SF SG

``` r
position[c(1, 3, 5)]
```

    ## [1] SG PF C 
    ## Levels: C PF PG SF SG

``` r
position[rep(1, 5)]
```

    ## [1] SG SG SG SG SG
    ## Levels: C PF PG SF SG

``` r
rookie[player == 'Iguodala']
```

    ## [1] FALSE
    ## Levels: FALSE TRUE

``` r
rookie[player == 'McCaw']
```

    ## [1] TRUE
    ## Levels: FALSE TRUE

### Why using R factors?

When or/and why to use factors? The simplest answer is: use R factors
when you want to handle categorical data as such. Often, statisticians
think about variables as categorical data, expressed in several scales:
binary, nominal, and ordinal. And R lets you handle this type of data
through factors. Many functions in R are specifically dedicated for
factors, and you can (should) take advantage of such behavior.
