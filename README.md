## 1. The Big Picture and R Survival Skills

- :card_index: __Dates__: Jan 28-Feb 01
- :paperclip: __Topics__: First things first. At the conceptual level we'll discuss how data analysis projects usually start with a Research Question. Also, we'll describe how Data can actually be seen from a triangular perspective (i.e. my "3 Views of Data"). At the practical level, you'll begin learning basic survival skills for R, followed by an overall review of the RStudio workspace. Then we move on to discuss basic data types and their implementation in R around vectors and other data structures.

## 2. More Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, and Dataframes

- :card_index: __Dates__: Feb 04-08
- :paperclip: __Topics__: In this week you'll keep learning more about R data structures like arrays and lists. More specifically, we'll focus on fundamental concepts like atomicity, vectorization, recycling, and subsetting. And given that we are studying vectors and its cousins, we'll briefly review the traditional _base_ graphics approach that is based on R vectors.

## 6. Housekeeping: Version Control with Git and GitHub

- :card_index: __Dates__: Mar 04-08
- :paperclip: __Topics__: We continue talking about filestructure topics, and we introduce basic notions of version control systems (VCS) using Git, and the companion hosting platform GitHub.
On the Data side, we begin our discussion about Tables: the most common form in which data is stored, handled, and manipulated. Consequently, we need to talk about the typical storage formats of tabular data, and the relationship between tables and R data frames.

## 11. More Regular Expressions

- :card_index: __Dates__: Apr 15-19
- :paperclip:  __Topics__: At its heart, computing involves working with numbers. However, a considerable amount of information and data is in the form of text. To unleash the power of strings manipulation, we need to take things to the next level and learn about Regular Expressions. Namely, Regular expressions are a tool that allows us to describe a certain amount of text called "patterns". We'll describe the basic concepts of regex and the common operations to match text patterns.
